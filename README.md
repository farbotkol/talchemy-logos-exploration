# talchemy-logos-exploration

50 deliberately different **T Alchemy** logo concepts for review.

## How to view
Open the latest gallery:
- `out/<timestamp>/index.html`

Each image is a PNG (transparent background). Prompts used are stored in:
- `prompts.json`
- `out/<timestamp>/generated.json`

## Notes
These are concept explorations (raster). Once we pick finalists, we should recreate them as vectors (SVG) with clean typography.
